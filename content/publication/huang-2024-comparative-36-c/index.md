abstract: Radio wave propagation modeling in railway environments is of fundamental
  importance in designing reliable train communication systems. In recent years, many
  machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied to accelerate the modeling process.
  In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have presented a superior performance
  in extracting features and reconstructing field distribution. However, the relevant
  literature is still missing a comprehensive study on CNN architecture design and
  the performance of different CNN models. In this article, we compare the performance
  of nine different CNNs, including recently developed advanced CNN techniques, for
  radio wave propagation modeling in tunnels. Each model is assessed in three different
  size variants to examine the effect of model complexity on performance. The CNN
  model is driven by a vector parabolic equation (VPE) channel simulator based on
  super-resolution. In addition, we investigate the performance of hybridizing various
  CNN architectures and present a CNN design roadmap for radio wave propagation modeling
  in tunnels. Besides, the proposed models are validated against measurement campaigns
  in two realistic tunnels.
