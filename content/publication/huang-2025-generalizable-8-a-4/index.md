abstract: The application of split-step parabolic equation methods for radio wave
  propagation across irregular terrains has gained widespread attention. However,
  the computational intensity of these methods limits their practical use, leading
  to the exploration of machine learning (ML) techniques as an alternative. A significant
  hurdle for ML models in the field of electromagnetics is their ability to precisely
  forecast relevant quantities in situations not covered by their training data, which
  have not been considered in the current ML-assisted propagation models over irregular
  terrain. To that end, we propose a generalizable physics-guided propagation modeling
  framework of high fidelity. This framework is adept at generalizing across various
  terrain types and antenna configurations, showcasing extrapolation capabilities
  beyond its training dataset. Our approach innovates by embedding prior knowledge
  from deterministic models into the network architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate
  that adapting the network structure to align with the electromagnetic properties
  of terrain propagation markedly improves the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy and generalizability.
