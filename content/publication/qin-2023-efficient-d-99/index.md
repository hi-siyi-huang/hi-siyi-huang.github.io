abstract: The vector parabolic equation (VPE) method has been widely applied to the
  modelling of radio wave propagation in tunnel environments. However, dense spatial
  discretizations are generally required for VPE simulations to achieve acceptable
  accuracy. This results in high computational costs for large‐size tunnels and high‐frequency
  wireless systems. This letter presents an efficient physics‐based recurrent neural
  network (RNN) model for modeling radio wave propagation in tunnels. The proposed
  RNN‐based model can leverage coarse‐mesh VPE to generate high‐fidelity received
  signal strength and achieve significant computational savings. The validity of the
  proposed approach is demonstrated against fine‐mesh VPE simulations in various tunnel
  cases. This letter presents an efficient physics‐based recurrent neural network
  model for modelling radio wave propagation in tunnels. The proposed recurrent neural
  network‐based model can leverage low‐cost simulations to generate high‐fidelity
  received signal strength and achieve significant computational savings.
