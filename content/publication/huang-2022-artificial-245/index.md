abstract: The vector parabolic equation (VPE) method has been widely applied to modeling
  radio wave propagation in guiding structures such as tunnels. However, simulation
  with VPE for long tunnels is computationally intensive. This paper proposes an efficient
  artificial neural network (ANN) based model for radio wave propagation prediction
  in tunnels with various cross-section geometries. The ANN model can accurately predict
  the received power based on tunnel geometry and antenna specifications. The performance
  of the proposed model has been validated through comparisons with VPE simulations.
