 abstract = {The vector parabolic equation (VPE) method has been widely applied to modeling radio wave propagation in guiding structures such as tunnels. However, simulation with VPE for long tunnels is computationally intensive. This paper proposes an efficient artificial neural network (ANN) based model for radio wave propagation prediction in tunnels with various cross-section geometries. The ANN model can accurately predict the received power based on tunnel geometry and antenna specifications. The performance of the proposed model has been validated through comparisons with VPE simulations.},
