abstract: Propagation models are essential for the prediction of received signal strength
  and the planning of wireless systems in a given environment. The vector parabolic
  equation (VPE) method has been widely applied to the modelling of radio wave propagation
  in tunnels. However, carrying out simulations for large‐scale environments is still
  computationally expensive. A convolutional neural network (CNN)‐based propagation
  model, which can provide high‐fidelity received signal strength prediction based
  on results from low‐cost VPE simulations, is proposed. A thorough study of the generalisability,
  including both interpolation and extrapolation capabilities, of the proposed CNN
  model is conducted. It is found that the proposed model can achieve significant
  computational savings while maintaining acceptable accuracy, and its performance
  is validated in both simulations and actual tunnel cases. In this paper, a convolutional
  neural network (CNN)‐based propagation model, which can provide high‐fidelity received
  signal strength prediction based on results from low‐cost vector parabolic equation
  (VPE) simulations, is proposed. A thorough study of the generalisability, including
  both interpolation and extrapolation capabilities, of the proposed CNN model is
  conducted.
