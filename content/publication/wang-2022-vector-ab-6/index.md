abstract: The vector parabolic equation (VPE) method has proven to be a powerful numerical
  technique for high-fidelity propagation modeling in long guiding structures such
  as tunnels. However, applying VPE to realistic large-scale environments remains
  a difficult task due to the requirement of high-performance computing resources.
  This paper proposes a computationally efficient convolutional neural network model,
  which can compensate numerical dispersion and provide high-fidelity received signal
  strength prediction based on results from coarse-mesh VPE simulations. The performance
  of the proposed model has been validated in various tunnel cases, with significantly
  reduced simulation time.
