abstract: The vector parabolic equation (VPE) method has been widely applied to modeling
  radio wave propagation in tunnels. However, simulation with VPE for long tunnels
  is still computationally expensive. This paper presents an efficient on-the-fly
  training convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can provide high-fidelity
  received signal strength (RSS) prediction without pre-training requirement. Coarse-mesh
  and dense-mesh VPE simulations are concurrently run for a short distance, while
  a CNN model which can use only the coarse-mesh VPE data to predict dense-mesh results
  for the whole tunnel is trained. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed model
  have been demonstrated through comparisons with full VPE simulations.
