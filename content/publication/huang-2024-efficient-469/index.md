abstract: Parabolic equation (PE) methods have been widely utilized for modeling radio
  wave propagation in tunnels due to their notable efficiency and fidelity. However,
  as emerging wireless communication systems in railway environments shift to higher
  frequency bands, the computational costs associated with PE methods become prohibitively
  high. To that end, this article proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
  propagation model that provides predictions of radio wave propagation at high frequencies
  by leveraging data obtained by the PE method at a lower frequency. The proposed
  model significantly enhances the efficiency of wave propagation modeling in tunnels.
  Meanwhile, by explicitly incorporating prior knowledge from PE simulations and carefully
  designing the input, output, and structures of the CNN, the proposed model is more
  generalizable and robust compared to existing data-oriented machine learning (ML)
  models. Numerical results are compared with predictions from conventional PE methods
  for various tunnel geometries, and the proposed model is also validated against
  experimental measurements in a realistic tunnel scenario.
