abstract: The vector parabolic equation (VPE) method is a promising tool for high-fidelity
  radio wave propagation modeling in large-scale guiding structures such as tunnels.
  However, simulation with VPE for a large distance still requires computing resources
  that can be practically prohibitive. This paper presents a convolutional neural
  network (CNN) based model that uses VPE simulations with low computing costs to
  provide high-fidelity received signal strength (RSS) prediction. The performance
  of three CNN models (i.e., basic CNN, sub-pixel CNN, and residual network) with
  different architectures and different upscaling methods is compared. Their accuracy
  and efficiency are tested in various tunnel cases.
