 abstract = {The vector parabolic equation (VPE) method is a promising tool for high-fidelity radio wave propagation modeling in large-scale guiding structures such as tunnels. However, simulation with VPE for a large distance still requires computing resources that can be practically prohibitive. This paper presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) based model that uses VPE simulations with low computing costs to provide high-fidelity received signal strength (RSS) prediction. The performance of three CNN models (i.e., basic CNN, sub-pixel CNN, and residual network) with different architectures and different upscaling methods is compared. Their accuracy and efficiency are tested in various tunnel cases.},
