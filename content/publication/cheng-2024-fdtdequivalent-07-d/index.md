abstract: This paper introduces a novel three-dimensional electromagnetic (EM) solver,
  grounded in theory and enhanced by integrating a convolutional neural network (CNN)
  with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The proposed solver is designed
  for efficient and precise full-wave simulation of large-scale structures. By substituting
  the traditional operators in the FDTD method with convolutional operators, our approach
  maintains the accuracy and stability inherent to the FDTD method, while also being
  ideally suited for parallel computations. Compared to existing models, our proposed
  CNN- FDTD solver demonstrates improved accuracy, efficiency, and flexibility. Numerical
  validations confirm its superior stability and computational efficiency.
